                My name is Phil, welcome to my website. Here I will be showcasing my web development projects as I build my portfolio,
                slowly but surely convincing those who visit (and myself) that I actually know what I am doing. Please don't utilize the <em>'Contact'</em> section of the site as I am pretty sure the <em>Submit</em> button will break something.
            </p>

            <p id="p2">
                I am currently enrolled in a web development bootcamp through the University of Utah, under the strict direction of a
                ruthless leader known only as “Q”. Who might this Q character be? Good question; but this site is about me, so take your
                questions elsewhere.
            </p>

            <p id="p3">
                Hopefully before too long you will find something on this site worth your time. And hopefully by that time the <em>Submit</em> button works so you can let me know.           
            </p>
